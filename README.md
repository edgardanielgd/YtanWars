## This is YtanWars!
A multiplayer game where you can attack and defend your bases without facing the enemy directly but by using amazing agents that do the work for you!

At the start of a match, you (and your team) will have to defend your side of the map by placing defenses (each character will have it's own agents with unique abilities and attributes). But that's not all! You will be able also to spawn attacking agents that can be sent to attack other teams bases! And to make it as much fun as we can, your character will have to move through all your team's side of map to place different defenses or attacking agents factories manually! That's your main task.
